# Ray_Tracing

This item is homework for me to finish in two days.

Normally, you will find that the code is quite familiar with the code in "RayTracingOneWeekend", but that doesn't mean I just copy the code. I'm just understand and then type them without any look at the source code.

After just "finish" the homework, I'd like to do some optimization in the code, which could help me to understand it better.

It's ok for anyone to download the code to learn and spread.
